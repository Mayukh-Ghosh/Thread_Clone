# Threads_Clone

Based on Next.js v13.4.10, TypeScript, and TailwindCSS, I created a clone of the Threads Web App.  
For login and authentication, Clerk was used.  
MongoDB is the database used.  
The process of uploading files is handled by UploadThing.  
Shadcn components were used for faster component building.
## Deployment
The Deployment is done with Netlify.   

Faced some issues with the environment variables while deploying the site. But now everthing is fine and working.
